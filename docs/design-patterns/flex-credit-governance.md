## Pattern: Flex Credit Governance — Value-to-Cost Alignment

**Intent**  
Ensure every Agentforce implementation delivers **measurable business value** relative to its **Flex Credit cost**.

---

### 🎯 Purpose
To make architectural and design decisions based on **value efficiency**, not just technical elegance.

---

### 💡 Quantify Before You Build
Before writing a single line of code, estimate both:

- **Expected Business Value** – e.g., time saved, conversions, revenue uplift  
- **Expected Flex Credit Cost** – based on model type, complexity, and usage frequency  

This establishes a baseline **ROI expectation**.

---

### 🧩 Select the Right Architecture for the Right Price
- Design for **value efficiency**, not maximum model complexity.  
- Use the **simplest model** and **minimal infrastructure** that meets the business outcome.  
- Balance performance, accuracy, and Flex Credit consumption — not just technical ambition.

---

### 💰 Prioritize High-ROI Use Cases
Focus resources where:

- The **value-to-cost ratio** is high  
- The **impact is visible** and measurable  
- **Credit consumption** remains sustainable at scale  

---

### 📏 Validate and Measure Post-Launch
Continuously track:

- **Actual Flex Credit consumption** vs. forecast  
- **Realized business value** vs. projections  

Adjust architecture or usage when ROI diverges from expectations.

---

### 🔁 Iterate with Governance
Integrate these checkpoints into project governance:

1. **Pre-build ROI assessment**  
2. **Post-launch ROI validation**  
3. **Regular optimization reviews**

---

**Guiding Principle** 📌  
An efficient architecture isn’t the one that costs least — it’s the one that delivers **the most business value per Flex Credit consumed**.
