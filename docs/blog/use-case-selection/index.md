# The #1 predictor of Agentforce success: Use-case selection

In my first 3 months back in a Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) role at Salesforce, I’ve been hands-on with the tech and up close with customers and partners rolling Agentforce out.

**Pattern observed:** the #1 predictor of success isn’t budget, skills, or hype — it’s **use-case selection**.

It doesn’t need to be flashy. It probably shouldn’t be complex. Pick something straightforward to build, delivers value quickly, and has a business case.

## 1️⃣ Use-Case Qualification Framework
Ask three questions **before** you start:
- Is the use-case clearly defined with a **measurable business outcome**?
- Is the **required data available & accessible now** (including licenses)?
- Is there a **committed timeline** or clear trigger for action?

## 2️⃣ Start Small to Win Big
Big-bang automation sounds great — real wins come from **frequent, simple, low-risk** tasks.

- **Avoid:** complex edge cases, high-error scenarios, unclear ownership  
- **Prioritise:** frequent actions, low variance, leveraging existing data

> Upcoming article: an **impact/effort matrix** to rank Agentforce use-cases.

## 3️⃣ Build the Business Case & Get Stakeholder Support
Good use-cases are common; great ones **deliver measurable business value** (increased profit or reduced cost).

- What’s the **measurable impact**?  
- Can you quantify **time saved**, **errors reduced**, **productivity gained**?  
- Who is the **executive sponsor** accountable for outcomes?

Yes, it’s work — but in the AI era, the **first draft can be automated**.
