# the-very-simple-list-of-agentforce-best-practices

A living, **opinionated** reference of Agentforce architecture principles, design patterns, and real-world lessons — distilled from hands-on Forward Deployed Engineering work and community contributions.  
*(See [Strong Opinions, Loosely Held](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/strong-opinions-loosely-held/) for the mindset behind this.)*

## 🎯 Purpose

Keep Agentforce projects focused on **business value**, not over-engineering.  
This site collects short, practical lessons from the field — what consistently works, what doesn’t, and why.

## 💡 Why “Very Simple”?

Simplicity isn’t the absence of complexity — it’s the discipline to keep focus on **what matters most**.  
Each principle or pattern is written to be:
- Clear enough to act on today  
- Flexible enough to evolve tomorrow  
- Grounded in experience, not theory
