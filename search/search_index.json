Frame the challenge. Example: \u201cAnswer our 10 most-asked customer questions, at the right time, using relevant knowledge.\u201d - Start with small, curated sets (e.g., one FAQ object) over giant unreviewed corpora. - Add pre-/post-filters (metadata, recency, role) before/after retrieval. - Expand scope incrementally only when quality data and ownership exist.</p> <p>What Works \u2705 - Focused use-case \u2192 scoped corpus. - Curated sources with owners and recency. - Guardrails + filters to control recall.</p> <p>What Breaks \u26a0\ufe0f - Treating the Agent as an all-knowing oracle. - Ingesting massive, unreviewed, unstructured data. - Skipping pre/post filtering.</p> <p>Trade-offs - Narrow scope may miss edge cases (mitigate via escalation to human or secondary search). - Requires content ownership and hygiene (but that\u2019s a feature, not a bug).</p> <p>Metrics - Answer accuracy on top-N intents. - Cost per resolved question (credits per answer). - Coverage of FAQs without human fallback. - Time-to-answer (p50/p95).</p> <p>Guiding Principle \ud83d\udccc If you wouldn\u2019t train a human on that messy knowledge base, don\u2019t expect an AI Agent to succeed either.</p>"},{"location":"evaluation/","title":"Evaluation","text":"<p>TODO: Describe evaluation strategies and metrics for Agentforce initiatives.</p>"},{"location":"examples/","title":"Examples","text":"<p>TODO: Provide practical examples demonstrating the best practices in action.</p>"},{"location":"principles/","title":"Principles","text":"<ul> <li>Start with outcomes \u2192 Good Agents always begin by defining the intended business outcome and the business case.  </li> <li>Define success criteria \u2192 Successful Agents have clear, measurable ways to know if they\u2019re working.  </li> <li>Use Job Stories \u2192 Writing simple Job Stories is a great way to design Agent architecture.  </li> <li>Tightly scope data \u2192 Define the minimum data needed to answer your Job Stories \u2014 this avoids unnecessary complexity.</li> <li>Start small and move fast \u2192 Don't wait until you have the perfect design.
