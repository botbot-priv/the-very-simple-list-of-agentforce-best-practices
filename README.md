# the-very-simple-list-of-agentforce-best-practices

A living, intentionally simple list.  
The goal: keep Agentforce projects focused on **business value**, not over-engineering.  

---

This repo collects simple, practical doâ€™s and donâ€™ts for working with Agentforce.  
The list itself lives here ðŸ‘‰ [BEST-PRACTICES.md](BEST-PRACTICES.md)
