# Contributing Guidelines 🎉

Thanks for stopping by! This project is meant to be a **very simple list** of Agentforce best practices.  
That means: short, practical tips that people can actually use — without drowning in detail.  

If you’ve got something that fits, we’d love to see it!

## 1. How to contribute
- Fork the repo 🍴  
- Create a branch with your changes 🌱  
- Add or update best practices in Markdown (`.md`) format ✍️  
- Open a Pull Request (PR) 🚀

## 2. Reviews (aka the "simplicity check")  
All PRs get a quick review before merging. This isn’t about gatekeeping — it’s just to make sure:  
- The tip is simple and clear 🧹  
- It actually belongs in a “best practices” list ✅  
- Formatting stays neat and tidy 📐  

Feedback is friendly and collaborative — think of it as editing, not red-pen grading.

## 3. Code of Conduct  
- Be kind.  
- Keep it constructive.  
- Remember: we’re here to make things simpler, not harder.
